# OSVersionHelper

A helper class to returned detailed information on the different Windows versions

The logic is in `WindowsVersionHelper`. Right now, only Windows is supported. PR's to add
support for other OS's is welcome.

## Credits

The code here is based on the [OS version detection](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/Microsoft.Toolkit.Win32/blob/9b7f04a9a81e70358e9d531e3b218e234c8ef5ef/WebView.Shared/Interop/OSVersionHelper.cs) in the Windows Community Toolkit. The code
there is internal, but I thought it'd be useful more generally.
